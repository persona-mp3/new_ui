This is a changelog regarding the reasons for the change in the final prototype.

1. User Interface & User Experience UI/UX:
In my original design document, I had made sure that I made use of  esssential whitespacing, clear branding and common conventions. However, while I was done developing the first prototype, the design was more cluttered than expected. The accent colors are everywhere, and they layout was not intutive, with lots of inconsistencies as the brand colors where everywhere. 
I also noticed how the color contrasts were very poor as the earlier shade of color scheme I had chosen where very poor. With that taken into account, I had made sure to reduce the use of Brand Coloring when not applicabale, and limited the styling to only call to action elements like 
- Book Meeting Buttons
- Logo Branding
- Highlighting specific words to draw user attention
After these iterative changes were made I decided to follow through with it with a more minimalist and consitent layout. Taking into account color contrasting, heirarchy and use of whitespace, resulting in a better prototype. 




Also  i HAD ensured replaced the images to make sure they suit the companys services more. All the images were gotten from open source websites as stated in my Asset Log Documentation, majority of these sites were:
- Cosmos for their bold and clear pictures. They offer tons of free images for differnet users as they also partner with Pinterest
- LummiAi is another website I got my assets from. They provide stock images generated by AI so all images are CopyRight Free
- The Icon I used was from Bootstrap Icons another open source platform





Other UI Elements I changed include form feilds, buttons, links, color branding and new interactive features
